Callback Canyon is a great way for a beginning to intermediate javascript developer to get some practice writing functional callback routines and the tests that validate the result.

The purpose of this challenge is not to write your own functional library, but to get some repetitions solving small, tiny problems and working though some of the syntax of the javascript language.

## How does it work?

There are is a check list of small callback functions in this document for each function, create a javascript file, then create a test file in the test directory. In the test/index file you import the test file and in the test file you will import your project file. When you save the files, you should see the results of your test in the browser.

## Setup

```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
yarn
yarn start
```

## Example walk through

Lets take the first callback `equals`.

Steps

* create an `equals.js` file in the `src` directory.
* create a `test/equals_test.js` file in the `test` directory.
* add the test boilier plate to the `test/equals.js` file.

```js
import test from 'tape'
import equals from '../src/equals'

test('equals should compare two values and return true or false', assert => {
  // Add Tests here
  assert.end()
})
```

### Defining Assertions

When writing test you are making assertions, I assert that when I execute the equals function with the arguments 1 and 1 it will return true, and when I execute the equals function with arguments 1 and 2 it will return false.

So once we have our assertions defined, we need to write the code.

```js
assert.ok(equals(1, 1))
assert.notOk(equals(true, false))
assert.ok(equals('hello', 'hello'))
```

> There are three main assertion methods, ok, equals, same
> ok - expects a true value for the assertion to pass
> equals - expects two arguments an actual and expected, they should be the same for the assertion to pass
> same - expects two arrays or objects an actual and expected, the should be identical for the assertion to pass

> you can prepend not before each method to reverse the assertion.

* now proceed to the `equals.js` file and add the following implementation

```js
/**
 * equals function
 *
 * takes two values and returns true if the values are the same
 *
 * @param a any
 * @param b any
 *
 * @returns boolean
 */
function equals(a, b) {
  return a === b
}

export default equals
```

> Remember to write documentation about what the function does
> not how it does it.
> Remember to always create an explicit return
> Remember to always export your function

* save all your work and verify you have a green screen in the browser.

* congrats, now check off the first exercise and proceed to the next one.

Solve each problem and then move to the next numbered file.

## Callbacks

> Bonus: make each function support currying as well as calling the functions with all of their arguments.
> example: `equals(1,1) === equals(1)(1)`
> there is a curryN function in your `src` directory

* [ ] equals

 
> Create a predicate function that compares two arguments and returns true of false based on value equality

> Why? Having a composable function that can return if two objects are equal can provide value as you combine multiple functions together and need to provide conditionals that may fork the dataflow.

* [ ] add

> Create a binary function that adds two numbers and returns the result as a number
> Why? Having a way to add two numbers, gives you the ability to compose computation.  

* [ ] subtract

> `(Number a, Number b) => a - b`
> Create a binary function that subtracts two number arguments and returns the result as a number
> Why? Having a way to subtract two numbers, gives you the ability to compose computation.

* [ ] multiply

> `(Number a, Number b) => a * b`
> Create a binary function that multiplies two number arguments and return the result as a number
> Why? Having a way to multiply two numbers, gives you the ability to compose computation.

* [ ] divide

> `(Number a, Number b) => a / b`
> Create a binary function that divides two number arguments and returns the result as a number
> Why? Having a way to divide two numbers, gives you the ability to compose computation.

* [ ] prop

> `(string, object) => object[string]`
> Create a binary function that takes a string as the first parameter and an object as the second parameter, then return the value of the property that has a name of the first argument from the second argument object, return null if there is no property of that name on the object.
> Why? Often times in a compose chain, you want to extract just the value of a property on a object data structure.

* [ ] path

> `(array, object) => object[...array]`
> Take an array and object as parameters, then use the array to drill down the properties of the
object to get a value, if no value is provided return null.
> Why? When accessing deep values of objects, if a property does not exist an exception will be thrown, by using an array to specify the chained values, you can get the value or a null, and no exception will be thrown if the property did not exist.
 
* [ ] inc

> `(Number) => Number + 1`
> This function takes a number and increments the number by 1, use the add function to create this function. 

* [ ] dec

> `(Number) => Number - 1`
> This function takes a number and decrements the number by 1, use the subtract function to create this function.

* [ ] identity

> `(value) => value`
> This function returns the value that is passed in to it as an input.

* [ ] always

> `(value) => () => value`
> This higher order function returns a function that when called will always return the value.

> The goal of this exercise is not to do all of these in one pass, but to practice a few every day, to get used to the following concepts:

* Thinking in small solutions
* Testing your code
* Documenting your code
* Getting used to JavaScript syntax
* Seeing results quickly

## share your progress

* tweet it out!
* share on linked in!

## Thank you

Thank you for using this project, it was made with <3 by the instructors at JRS Coding School. We want to see every developer succeed and maybe this tool can help you in that part of the journey.
